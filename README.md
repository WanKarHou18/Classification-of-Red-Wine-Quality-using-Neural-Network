Classification of Red Wine Quality using Neural Network

### Problem Statement
Quality is always the main component for improvement of wine making in wine industries .The quality of wine is difficult to define, as it is a multi-faceted construct, and lacking of generally accepted definition, yet this is most certainly accredited to everyoneâ€™s different perception of quality. As technology advanced, a more scientific method used   to determine the quality of wine was introduced by scientist which was physicochemical. Physicochemical lab test used to characterize wine into the determination of density, alcohol or pH values and others. Nonetheless, the relationship between the physicochemical and sensory analysis is complex and still not fully understood.

### Description

By applying ML models such as neural network, quality of red wine can accurately be classified based on certain inputs such as Fixed acidity, Volatile acidity, etc. Dataset of the project can be obtained from USCI (<https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality>).  
Different ML models such as SVM, Random Forest are applied to perform the same task, accuracy result is obtained and compared.
