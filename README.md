Classification of Red Wine Quality using Neural Network

### Description

By applying ML models such as neural network, quality of red wine can accurately be classified based on certain inputs such as Fixed acidity, Volatile acidity, etc. Dataset of the project can be obtained from USCI (<https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality>).  
Different ML models such as SVM, Random Forest are applied to perform the same task, accuracy result is obtained and compared.
